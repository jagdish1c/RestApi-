# RestApi-
Project Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the REST API project developed using Spring Boot, Spring Tool Suite (STS), MySQL, and Postman. The project follows the Model-Controller-Service architecture, where each component plays a specific role in handling various functionalities of the API.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building robust Java applications.
Spring Tool Suite (STS): Integrated development environment for Spring applications.
MySQL: Relational database management system.
Postman: API development and testing tool.

API Architecture
The REST API project follows a layered architecture, consisting of the following components:

Entities: Data models that represent the domain objects of the application.
Repository: Data access layer responsible for interacting with the MySQL database.
Service Interface: Defines the contract for business logic operations.
Service Implementation: Implements the business logic defined in the service interface.
Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns appropriate responses.

Project Setup and Configuration
Provide instructions on setting up the development environment, configuring the database connection, and running the project locally.

API Testing with Postman
Provide examples of how to use Postman to test the API endpoints. Include screenshots or descriptions of sample requests and responses.

Conclusion
In this documentation, we have outlined the architecture and functionality of the REST API project developed using Spring Boot, Spring Tool Suite, MySQL, and Postman. The project follows a Model-Controller-Service architecture, providing endpoints for user-related operations. For more details, refer to the source code and comments within the project files.
